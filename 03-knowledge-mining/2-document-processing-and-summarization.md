# Lab 2 - Document Processing and Summarization with Azure Document Intelligence and AI Service for Language

## Estimated Duration : 2 Hours 30 Minutes

This lab covers Azure AI Services, particularly [Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search/) and the [Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence) service.

## Lab Objectives

- Task 1 - Explore the dashboard of COVID-19 data
- Task 2 - Explore lab scenario
- Task 3 - Creating Azure Search Indexes
- Task 4 - Querying Azure Search Indexes
- Task 5 - Updating Azure Search Indexes
- Task 6 - Using the Document Intelligence Studio
- Task 7 - Document Summarization via AI Service for Language Integration

## Task 1 - Explore the dashboard of COVID-19 data

Understanding the source datasets is very important in AI and ML. To help you expedite the process, we have created a Power BI dashboard you can use to explore them at the beginning of each lab.

![Azure AI in a Day datasets](./media/SHC1.png)

To get more details about the source datasets, check out the [Data Overview](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/ai-in-a-day/blob/main/data-overview.md) section.

To explore the dashboard of COVID-19 data, open the `Azure-AI-in-a-Day-Data-Overview` file located on the desktop (**C:\Users\public\desktop**) ðŸ’» of the virtual machine provided with your environment. If you see the `Introducing the updated mobile layout` pop-up screen, then close it by clicking on `Got it`. Collapse the **Fields** and **Visualizations** tabs to see the clear report.

 ![Azure AI in a Day datasets](./media/powerbireportopen.png)

> **Note:** Please close and reopen the Power BI Desktop document if it throws an error on the first attempt.

## Task 2 - Explore lab scenario

Another critical problem to deal with when it comes to the volumes of research documents covering COVID-19 is the problem of advanced indexing and searching their content. The specific internal structure of research papers (including citations, contributors, and various entities like diagnosis, forms of examination, family relations, genes, medication, symptoms or signs, and treatments) form a reach semantic graph that goes way beyond simple document categorization. An analyst would benefit significantly from exploring the corpus of documents in a way that considers all these complex relationships.

Using the AI Search capabilities, we will create a complex index of documents that allows an analyst to perform an advanced search and explore the inter-document graph relationships.

The following diagram highlights the portion of the general architecture covered by this lab.

![Azure AI in a Day datasets](../media/updated-arch-lab2.png)

The high-level steps covered in the lab are:

- Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data
- Explore lab scenario
- Explore the document search process
- Explore the graph search process
- Add a set of new documents and trigger the index update process
- Explore the document and graph search and identify updated results

## Task 3 - Creating Azure Search Indexes

1. Navigate to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in with your credentials. Then, select **Resource groups**.

    ![Open Azure resource group](media/SHC2a.3.1.png)

   ![](media/ai-sa-cs.png)

1. Open **File Explorer** from the task bar and navigate to the path `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\`. There are six files, three prefixed with `abstracts` and three with `covid19temp`.

1. Open the `abstracts_datasource.schema` file with a text editor and replace the segment starting `<< TODO:` with your Storage account connection string **<inject key="storageAccountConnectionString" enableCopy="true"/>** and then save the file.

    ![The abstract data source is ready to be updated.](media/edit-abstracts-datasource.png)

1. Open the `covid19temp_datasource.schema` file with a text editor and replace the segment starting `<< TODO:` with your Storage account connection string **<inject key="storageAccountConnectionString" enableCopy="true"/>** and then save the file.

1. Now, open the `AzureSearchIndex.ps1` file with a text editor and copy the code present in it.

1. Open a new PowerShell prompt and navigate to the following directory:

    ```
    cd C:\Temp\AzureSearch\
    ```
 
1. Paste the copied code from the **AzureSearchIndex.ps1** file and press enter to create an Azure Search data source, index, and indexer.

    ![The Create-AzureSearchIndex function has been created in PowerShell.](media/create-azuresearchindex.png)

1. In the same PowerShell prompt, call this function for the `abstracts` index and the `covid19temp` index.

    Make sure to update the Azure Search account name and Azure Search API key in the below commands and then run.
   
     - Azure Search Account Name: **aiinaday-cog-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
     - Azure Search API key: You saved the Primary admin key in the text editor in step 5, use that

    ```powershell
    Create-AzureSearchIndex "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts_datasource.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts_indexer.schema" "AZURE SEARCH ACCOUNT NAME" "API KEY"
    ```

1. Review the details and click on **Create project**.

   ![Project](media/SHC2a.6.13.png)
  
1. After creating a new project, you will be sent to the project for tagging in Label data. Select **+Add a Field** **(1)** to create a new field click on **Field** **(2)**, type `Abstract` in the Field, and hit enter. By this, you have created a new Abstract Field.

   ![The Abstract tag has been created](media/innovate5.png)
    
   ![The Abstract tag has been created](media/lab2a-t6-frs9.png)

1. Click on **Run layout**.Wait for the layout to be run for the first document and locate the document's abstract. Note that for some documents, the abstract is on the second page. Then, move on to the next document. We will tag each of the five papers, so navigate to each in turn, allowing the layout to be run. In order for tagging to be successful, we must first run the layout of a document, navigate to another document, and return to this first document before we begin tagging. Layout generation happens once per document, after which we can return to it and tag our abstract.

   ![Running layout for a document](media/L2-T6-S15.png)

   ![Running layout for a document](media/lab2a-t6-frs7.png)

1. Return to the second PDF and select each word in the **Abstract** section. After highlighting this, select the **Abstract** tag to tag this section. Note that you will need to select each word individually rather than selecting a box. After selecting the **Abstract** tag, you should see a tag logo next to the PDF. If you see the tag logo, this means that tagging was successful for this document.

   ![The first PDF has been viewed, and the second PDF has been tagged](media/L2-T6-S16.1.png)

1. Return to the first PDF and highlight the word **ABSTRACT** and the abstract. If the abstract is lengthy, as in this example, it is okay to include just the first paragraph. Then, select the **Abstract** tag to tag this document. Ensure that the viewed icon (an eye) changes to a tag icon. If it does not change to a tag but instead changes to a blank spot without any icons, tagging was unsuccessful. In the event that tagging is unsuccessful, select another document, wait for it to have its layout run, and then return to the prior document and try tagging again.

   ![The first PDF has been tagged](media/L2-T6-S17.png)

1. Continue tagging until all five of the top papers are tagged. Once we have tagged five documents, select the **Train** option.
    
   ![The first five PDFs have been tagged](media/L2-T6-S18.png)

1. In a pop-up to Train a new model, enter **Abstracts (1)** as the ModelID, and select the **Neural (Recommended) (2)** from the drop-down as Build Mode. Then click on **Train (3)**.

   ![The option to train a model has been selected](media/form-model.png)

1. Training a model may take up to 45-60 minutes to succeed. Click on **Go to models**. 

   ![The option to train a model has been selected](media/lab2a-t6-frs14.png)

    >**Note**: As Training a model will take up to 45-60 minutes to succeed. No need to wait for it, you can continue with next Lab. Come back later and review it after an hour.

1. After the model has finished training, you will see that the Status has succeeded.  Although the estimated accuracy is not great, we will use this model.

   ![The Abstracts model has been trained](media/lab2a-t6-frs15.png)

1. From the left menu, select the **Test (1)**. Click on **Browse for a file (2)**.

## Task 7 - Document Summarization via AI Service for Language Integration

Summarization is one of the features offered by [Azure AI Service for Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/AI-services/language-service/overview), a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for developing intelligent applications that involve written language. Use this article to learn more about this feature, and how to use it in your applications.

In general, there are two approaches for automatic document summarization: extractive and abstractive. This API provides extractive summarization. Extractive summarization is a feature that produces a summary by extracting sentences that collectively represent the most important or relevant information within the original content. This feature is designed to shorten content that users consider too long to read. Extractive summarization condenses articles, papers, or documents to key sentences. The AI models used by the API are provided by the service, you just have to send content for analysis.

In this task, we are creating a text summarization application with the client library for Python. You will create a Python application that can summarize documents or text-based customer service conversations.

1. Return to the Azure Portal page and navigate to the **AI-in-a-Day** resource group and select the Azure AI services multi-service account **aiinaday-cogsv<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

    ![The AI Services service is selected](media/inn13.png)

2. Select the **Keys and Endpoint (1)** option under Resource Management.  Then, copy the value for **KEY 1 (2)** and the **Endpoint (3)**.  Paste these into a text file for later use.

    ![The AI Services key and endpoint are selected](media/inn14.png)

3. In the labvm, open a command prompt (`cmd.exe`). To do this, open the Windows menu, type in `cmd`, and select the **Command Prompt** application.

    ![The Command Prompt application is selected](media/open-cmd.png)

4. Run the below command. To run this, you must have Python installed on the machine. If `python.exe` is not accessible as part of the path--meaning you get an error when trying to run `pip`, navigate to where Python is installed.  The `pip.exe` program is inside the `\Scripts\` folder.

    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.2.0b1
    ```
